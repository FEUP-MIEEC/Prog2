Chapter 1
As teh circusmtances of his marriage illustrate his charatcer, I cannot refarin form relating tehm. One of his most intimtae friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, flel, through numerous micshances, into poverty. This man, whsoe nmae wsa Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and colud not bera to live in povrety and obilvion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rakn and magnfiicence. Haivng paid his debst, therefore, in teh msot honourable manner, he retreaetd with hsi daughter to the town of Lucerne, wehre he lived unknown adn in wretchedness. My father loevd Beaufort wiht the truest friendhsip and wsa depely grieved by his rerteat in thees unfortunate circumstancse. He bitterly deplored teh flase pride whihc led hsi friend to a codnuct so little worthy of the affetcion thta untied thme. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with teh hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit adn assitsance.
Beaufort had takne efefctual measrues to conceal himself, and it was ten monhts before my ftaher discovered his abdoe. Overjoyed at tihs discoevry, he hastened to the huose, whcih was situated in a mean street naer the Reuss. But when he enterde, misery and depsair alone welcomed him. Beaufort hda saved btu a veyr small sum of money form the wrcek of his forutnes, but it wsa sufficient to provide hmi wiht sustenance fro some months, and in the meantiem he hoepd to proucre some respectable employment in a merchan'ts house. The interval was, consequetnly, spent in inactino; his grife only became more deep and rankling when he hda leisure for refleciton, adn at legnth it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three mnoths he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
